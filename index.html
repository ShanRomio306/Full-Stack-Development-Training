            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>
                    The tradition of the campfire at our college in Kottayam began as a humble gathering of students who wished to celebrate unity, creativity, and friendship under the open sky. What started as a small initiative by the cultural committee
                     has now grown into one of the most anticipated events in the academic calendar, symbolizing warmth, togetherness, and youthful energy.<br><br>The earliest campfire was organized nearly a decade ago, when a group of enthusiastic seniors proposed
                      the idea of creating an informal evening where students could share stories, sing songs, and showcase talents outside the classroom. With the support of faculty and administration, the first campfire was held on the college grounds, using simple arrangements 
                      of wood, music, and handmade decorations. That evening marked the beginning of a legacy that continues to inspire new batches every year.<br><br>Over time, the campfire evolved into a structured cultural event. Student clubs began contributing performances ranging 
                      from folk dances and acoustic music to poetry recitals and skits. The fire itself became a symbol of continuity—its flames representing the spirit of learning and the bonds formed during college life. Each year, the campfire was not just about entertainment but also about 
                      reflection, as seniors shared memories and juniors expressed their excitement for the journey ahead.<br><br>The campfire also became a platform for inclusivity. Students from diverse backgrounds found common ground in the circle around the fire, exchanging traditions and experiences. 
                      Local cultural elements from Kottayam, such as Kerala folk songs and traditional instruments, were gradually woven into the program, giving the event a unique regional flavor. Faculty members often joined in, blurring the lines between teacher and student, and reinforcing the sense of community.<br><br>
                      In recent years, the campfire has expanded with modern touches—sound systems, themed decorations, and collaborative performances that blend tradition with contemporary art forms. Yet, the essence remains unchanged: it is a night of laughter, music, and shared stories under the stars. For many alumni,
                       the campfire is remembered as a defining moment of their college life, a symbol of belonging and joy.<br><br>Today, the campfire stands as a proud tradition of our college in Kottayam, 
                    reminding us that beyond academics, it is the friendships, creativity, and collective spirit that truly shape our journey. It continues to burn brightly, carrying forward the legacy of unity and celebration for generations to come.
